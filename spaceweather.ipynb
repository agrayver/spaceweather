    "- LEFS150: 7 channels, E1-E4, FP5-FP7. E1-E3 unusable after DOY 78, 1998, however, so we will ignore these. This detector measures electrons with energies less than about 350keV.\n",

During conversion, we ignored channels that became noisy early in the satellite's operation (as listed above), and we also interpolated all of the time series to a constant, one minute spacing."
